# Cock-clock
A clock devoted to chickens.  

Made with resources from Skillcrush Frontend Developer Blueprint.  

Variables are set to determine which hours will have certain clock responses (messages and pictures). User has options to select 3 times that have additional responses when the live time falls into that range. The clock is updated once per second, changing the visible clock time, as well as the message and picture if the time falls into a new time range.  

To-do:
* Add alarm or alert when user chooses 3 custom times
* Make chicken noises at the time range changes (morning rooster, lunch eating sounds, evening sleeping sounds, etc)
* Way to deal with the custom times using the same time ranges/overlapping (currently only one picture/message will display)
* Better visuals and fit on the page, CSS is weak
* Make it an app? Something actually usable?
